  My name is Ekapope Viriyakovithya. 
  I am currently pursuing MSc Big Data Analytics for Business at IÃ‰SEG School of Management (Lille, France) (EQUIS,AACSB,AMBA).
  My studies focus on several Business Analytics and Decision Making Tools (Commercial and Open Source) both  theoretical principles and operational analytical predictive modeling.
  
  I have a strong background in analytical thinking skill and I am a fact-based decision maker.
  These skills have been significantly improved while I worked as the lead engineer in the oil field service company 
  where I often applied the root cause analysis methodology and decision making skill 
  through hands-on work experience to initiate the preventive solutions for future problems. 
  I have been exposed to the fact-based management application and 
  came to appreciate the importance of data-driven organization in particular.
